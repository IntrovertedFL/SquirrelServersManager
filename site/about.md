SSM is currently in active development and not yet ready for production. I am open-sourcing it (I am working on it alone right now) to start collaborating with community contributors.

## Welcome to SSM!

SSM blends the automation powerhouse of Ansible with the portable setup of Docker in a clean and engaging interface.

Forget the days of command line complexities. SSM's simplified dashboard places the full potential of Ansible and Docker at your fingertips. Effortlessly navigate from deployment to monitoring via clicks, not code.

Born from a love for open source, we've crafted this toolkit to be community-backed and user-focused. It's the ideal pick for developers and IT teams who crave simplicity without sacrificing power.

Rediscover Ansible and Docker as they unite under one intuitive, open-source interface.

Welcome to simplicity and power in perfect harmony.

## Why build SSM?

I couldn't find any tools for my homelab that allowed me to manage my 5 Raspberry Pis and 3 Ubuntu servers with a nice UI. So, I decided to code it!

## Why Squirrel?

Consider all your devices as nuts. A squirrel loves to gather them all in some hole in a tree. That's what we are doing here! Also, squirrels are cute!

## Join Us(Me)!

SSM is still in its early stages. I have a lot of ground to cover, and I won't be able to do this without help from community contributors. I am also actively looking for more team members with long-term commitment.
