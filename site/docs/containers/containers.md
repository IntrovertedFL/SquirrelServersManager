Currently, SSM uses a modified version of WhatsUpDocker, utilizing the same [flags and filters](/docs/technical-guide/containers-labelling.md).

## Update available flag
When an update for a container's image is available, a tag is displayed on the tile.

If your container image is stored in a `Private Registry`, you must add a [private registry authentication](/docs/settings/registry.md)

## Force refresh
You can force a refresh of the current container statuses and available updates by clicking on the button in the top right corner.
