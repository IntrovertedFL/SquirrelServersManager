## What is ansible.cfg?
The `ansible.cfg` file is the primary configuration file for Ansible. It allows users to customize the behavior of Ansibleâ€™s commands and modules. This file can set default values for various settings, such as inventory paths, remote user credentials, connection parameters, and more.

:::info
The `ansible.cfg` file is used by every playbook execution by SSM.

## Sections in `ansible.cfg`
The `ansible.cfg` file contains various sections, each controlling a different aspect of Ansible's operation. Key sections include:
- **Defaults**: Sets default behavior for Ansible commands.
- **Privilege Escalation**: Configures parameters for privilege escalation (become).
- **SSH Connection**: Manages SSH connection parameters.
- **Inventory**: Specifies paths and settings for inventory files.
- **Logging**: Configures logging options.
- **Retries**: Sets retry parameters for unreachable hosts.

For further information, see [Ansible Configuration Settings](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/config.html#ansible-configuration-settings).

## Customizing `ansible.cfg` in SSM
Ansible configuration settings can be set directly inside the UI under the Advanced settings. Here, you can activate/deactivate variables, and add or delete them.

The file can also be edited manually in your local storage (default mounted volume path is `.data.prod/config`).
